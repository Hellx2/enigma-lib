  The overall collection of files that is this repository. All files in this repository are included.

CONDITIONS:
- Contributors may not bring the entire project team to court on account of their actions. If a charge is placed against the team, the only ones
  that may be brought to court are ones who actively contributed to the reason of the lawsuit. For example, if a contributor placed malware into
  the files, then that contributor, as well as the manager who verified it, may be taken to court in a lawsuit, and we encourage that any malware
  is reported as soon as it is found, and if action is not taken within 24 hours of recieval of the report, then the owners of the project may be
  taken to court as well, on the charge of report ignorance, convicting them as well.

  can be convicted for doing so, even if they did nothing to support it.
